    Steps
   </h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Prepare the Chicken:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If using whole chicken breasts, slice them horizontally to create thin cutlets, or pound them between two sheets of plastic wrap to an even thickness, about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Set Up Breading Stations:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Flour: Place the flour in a shallow dish or plate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Egg Wash: In a separate shallow dish, beat the eggs and milk together until well combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Breadcrumb Mixture: In another shallow dish, combine the breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese (if using), salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and dried herbs.
            </li>
        </ul>
    <li>
        Bread the Chicken:
    </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Dredge each chicken cutlet in the flour, shaking off any excess.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dip the floured cutlet into the egg wash, coating it completely.
            </li>
            <li>
                Press the cutlet into the breadcrumb mixture, ensuring it is evenly coated on both sides. Press down lightly to help the breadcrumbs adhere.
            </li>
        </ul>
    <li>
        Cook the Chicken:
    </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Heat a generous amount of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the oil is hot, add the breaded chicken cutlets in a single layer. Do not overcrowd the pan; cook in batches if necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fry the cutlets for about 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (75°C).
            </li>
        </ul>
        
   </ol>
