<h2>
    Description
</h2>

    Brownies are a popular, indulgent dessert known for their rich, chocolatey flavor and dense, fudgy texture. They are typically square or rectangular pieces of baked chocolate goodness, often featuring a slightly crispy top layer that gives way to a moist and chewy interior.

            1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter

        <li>
            1 cup (200g) granulated sugar

            2 large eggs
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon vanilla extract
        </li>
        <li>
            1/3 cup (40g) unsweetened cocoa powder  
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 cup (65g) all-purpose flour
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 teaspoon salt
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 teaspoon baking powder
        </li>
    </ul>

<h2>
    Steps
</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x9 inch baking pan or line it with parchment paper.
    </li>
    <li>
        Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.
    </li>
    <li>
        Stir in the sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract until well blended.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the cocoa powder, flour, salt, and baking powder. Mix until combined. Do not overmix.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fold in any optional add-ins like chocolate chips or nuts.
    </li>
    <li>
        Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread it evenly.
    </li>
    <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the brownies begin to pull away from the sides of the pan and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Let the brownies cool in the pan before cutting into squares.
    </li>
</ol>
